The implementation of this algorithm has been developed under WSL with Ubuntu. To run the code, you need to clone the repository for example via https with
```
git clone https://github.com/felixele217/algorithm-2d-tukey-depth.git
```

Then, you need to install python3, pip (a package manager for python packages) and the library matplotlib, which is needed for plotting the graph. In WSL, you can do this with the following commands:
```
sudo apt update && upgrade
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip ipython3
